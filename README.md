The dataset used in this study was obtained from the [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehradaria/leukemia), specifically focusing on the classification and segmentation of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and its subtypes. The dataset comprises 3,256 microscopic images derived from 89 patients under investigation for ALL at the bone marrow laboratory of Taleqani Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Among these patients, 25 were diagnosed as healthy with benign conditions (hematogones), while 64 were confirmed to have various ALL subtypes.
